## Business Context

Fiat wants to make the 500 full-electric model its best-selling one, obtaining the largest market share for small electric cars (A & B sectors).
To do this, Fiat must attract a larger audience, convincing the “crowd” of the product’s strengths. 
In so doing, the company can leverage both the novel pro-green regulations issued by the government and the positive reactions widespread in early adopters and critics. 
However, it has also to face an always more crowded competitive arena, populated by rival companies such as Mini, Honda and its sister brands Vauxhall and Peugeot.

To help the company achive its goal the following questions need to be adressed with regards to its iconic 500 model within the UK market:
- Identify the audience sentiment, and what meanings are attached to the new 500 BEV. How do they differ from the more traditional Fiat 500 Hybrid?
- Examine if there is any difference in the audience sentiment between the FIAT brand and the “Fiat 500” brand.
